		I found the single instance was faster than the load balancer because we are making a direct connection.

		Having multiple threads making requests to the web application causes the response times to be slower and jdbc is affected as well.
		Multiple request consume more cpu power. However when using 10 threads, going through the whole query_load.txt file was faster than using a single thread.
		This is because the overall average query time did not increase 10x; there is a good amount of network overhead of about 50ms. 
		However the servlet time and jdbc was affected by about 10x

		Using a secure connection seemed to be a little bit slower because there is more overhead making the connection to the servlet.
		JDBC and servlet average time were not affected. This is because when the timer for the servlet and jdbc are made
		we don't include the overhead of making the secure connection.

		Having prepared statements did not affect the jdbc time too much. Prepared statements prevent sql injection and are compiled.

		We are taking already open connections and making queries from those connections. Then after we are done we put the connections back into the pool.

		The response times for the load balancer are a little slower because we are not making a direct connection to the end server. We have to ask
		go through one extra node before reaching the destination. Then the load balancer passes back the request. Using 1 thread with load balancing is slower
		because a single instance can easily handle 1 request quickly.

		Using multiple threads to make requests to the servers with load balancing helped a significant amount. All the average times are about 2x as fast as a single instance.
		The load balancer would put about half the request in the master and half into the slave so that the user would get responses faster.
		The average query time multiplied by a little under 2x. The servlet time increased by 5x and jdbc increased by about 5x. (5 threads for each instance)

		Having no prepared statements did not make a noticable difference in any of the times. They were all about the same. This is because we are only making 1 prepared statement per request.
		If we batched the prepared statements it would be faster. JDBC's average time was quicker because it is compiled. The servlet average time increased because there is more text processing
		that the servlet needs to do in order to prepare the statement.
