We use the like predicate in our Advanced search to search for title, star's first name, last name, genres, and director.
for example if we wanted to find the matrix, there are 3 matrix movies. we would search "select * from movies where title like '%matrix%'"
we did the same thing for the other fields.

We also used it for browse by letter's first name. 
for example if we want to search for movies by the letter 'A' we would query: "select * from movies where title like 'A%'"

The java files that we use the like predicate in are: AdvancedSearchService.java and MovieTitle.java
