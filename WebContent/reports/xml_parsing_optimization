hi TA,

Here are my optimizations:
1) I used autoCommit = false and then commited every 1000 row inserts to not run out of memory.
2) Also I used PreparedStatements to optimize my code.

My program takes a little of 10 seconds to run if there are no duplicate entries, however it will take longer if there are duplicate entries.
